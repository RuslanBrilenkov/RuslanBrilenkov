# Hello there 👋

I am Ruslan Brilenkov, Human 😄, Husband :couple:, Data Scientist :man_technologist:, & Writer :black_nib:.

Data Science allows me to combine my passion for science and analyzing complex problems through data analysis. I believe that the power of numbers can shape the world around us, and I am eager to turn that belief into impactful solutions.

With a background in astrophysics and a love for data, I am on the lookout for a Data Scientist role where I can apply my creative and collaborative problem-solving skills in statistics and machine learning to create products that make a difference in people's lives.

Having recently moved to Waterloo, Ontario, Canada I am excited to bring my expertise to a local role where I can directly contribute to the community.


## 🔭 What I am up to:

- Tackling unique challenges with cutting-edge data, from acquisition to analysis and beyond.
  
- Using analytical and programming skills to uncover new insights and share them through storytelling and visualization.


## 🌱 When I am not data sciencing, you will find me:

- Sharing my knowledge about AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, and actionable step-by-step Python guides (links below).
  
- Staying active and indulging in some painting and guitar playing.
