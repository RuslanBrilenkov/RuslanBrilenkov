# Hello there 👋

I am Ruslan Brilenkov, Human 😄, Hasband :couple:, Data Scientist :man_technologist:, & Writer :black_nib:.

Currently, I am pursuing a Doctorate (Ph.D.) degree in Astrophysics at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute (Groningen, the Netherlands). 


## 🔭 I am currently working on:
- solving unique problems using state-of-the-art data, including:
  - data acquisition, pre-processing/cleaning;
  - validating data for uniformity and accuracy;
  - performing data and error analysis;
- applying efficient analytical and programming skills to analyse the data and bring new insights into existing problems, including:
  - storytelling and visualization;
  - presentation of the outcomes (talks, posters, publications);


## 🌱 In my free time I love:
- writing about DS, ML, Python guides for Personal Growth & day-to-day life;
- working out;
- bird-watching;
- painting & playing guitar;
