# Hello there 👋

I am Ruslan Brilenkov, Human 😄, Husband :couple:, Data Scientist :man_technologist:, & Writer :black_nib:.


Data Science allows me to combine my passion for science and analyzing complex problems through data analysis. I have always wondered how several numbers, when put together, can give insights that could change the course of an event.

I am seeking a Data Scientist role because I have creative problem-solving, cross-functional teamwork, statistics, and machine learning skills making me a perfect fit for this role. I want my knowledge to be transformed into a product that helps people.

Looking forward to applying my problem-solving, machine learning, and programming skills for solving a wide variety of real-world business problems. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Doctorate (Ph.D.) degree in Astrophysics at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute (University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands). 


## 🔭 I am currently working on:
- solving unique problems using state-of-the-art data, including:
  - data acquisition, pre-processing/cleaning;
  - validating data for uniformity and accuracy;
  - performing data and error analysis;
- applying efficient analytical and programming skills to analyse the data and bring new insights into existing problems, including:
  - storytelling and visualization;
  - presentation of the outcomes (talks, posters, publications);


## 🌱 In my free time I love:
- writing about Data Science, Machine Learning, and actionable step-by-step Python guides (link below);
- working out;
- bird-watching;
- painting & playing guitar;
